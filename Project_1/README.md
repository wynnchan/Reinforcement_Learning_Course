### Factors Part

To reproduce results in the factors selection part, you should implement factorbandit.py and the figures will be saved in .\factors\_figures.

This repo also contains the python scripts (generatefactors.py) for producing factors. Although this python file doesn't require external data sources, it runs quite slowly so you're recommended not to run this file since all the factors are already saved in .\factors.

### Portfolios Part

To reproduce results in the portfolios selection part, you should implement portfoliobandit.py and the figures will be saved in .\portfolio\_figure.

This repo also contains the python scripts (return\_cal\_portfolio.py) for constructing portfolios. Although this python file doesn't require external data sources, it runs quite slowly so you're recommended not to run this file since all the portfolios are already saved in .\portfolios.
